# Features 

## The Colour Scheme
The color scheme used was based on the typical bulldog colouring.  The colours used are also calming and relaxing and that is the feeling the Users should have when they visit the website.  THis pallet was generated using [Color Fetch](https://www.colorfetch.com/)

![Colour Scheme](docs/colour-scheme.webp)

## The Fonts Used

The fonts used were a mix of soft and strong.  This is a reflection on the nature of the bulldog, they look big bold and strong but behind all that image is a very soft caring animal. The aim of this website was also to enhance the Users experience by presenting the information in a clear, legible format. The fonts used satisfied this requirement as they did not over power any other features of the website and protrayed the neccassary information in a clear easy to read mannor.

# Commit History

During the development of this site, I made several commits, however following research into how and when commits technically should be completed and from reading this article [How often should you commit](https://medium.com/@asifnahian/git-how-often-should-you-commit-c133e5473d76) I developed a clearer understanding of the commit process. 
That being said the rationale behind my numerous commits for this website developement was:

- Learning process: As I was learning how to use Git and GitHub, I made frequent commits to grasp version control better.

- Safety net: Frequent commits act as a safety net. If something goes wrong, I can easily revert to a previous state without losing much progress.

- Granularity of changes: Each commit reflects specific improvements or changes made to the project, helping to track its progress over time.

<br>
# Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
  - Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
