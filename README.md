## The Fonts Used

The fonts used were a mix of soft and strong.  This is a reflection on the nature of the bulldog, they look big bold and strong but behind all that image is a very soft caring animal. The aim of this website was also to enhance the Users experience by presenting the information in a clear, legible format. The fonts used satisfied this requirement as they did not over power any other features of the website and protrayed the neccassary information in a clear easy to read mannor.

# Commit History

During the development of this site, I made several commits, however following research into how and when commits technically should be completed and from reading this article [How often should you commit](https://medium.com/@asifnahian/git-how-often-should-you-commit-c133e5473d76) I developed a clearer understanding of the commit process. 
That being said the rationale behind my numerous commits for this website developement was:

- Learning process: As I was learning how to use Git and GitHub, I made frequent commits to grasp version control better.

- Safety net: Frequent commits act as a safety net. If something goes wrong, I can easily revert to a previous state without losing much progress.

- Granularity of changes: Each commit reflects specific improvements or changes made to the project, helping to track its progress over time.

<br>
# Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
